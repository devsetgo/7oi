Syntyche is a fifteen-year-old girl who lives in a world struggling to survive the aftermath of religious wars and a
controlling government. Her unique ability to see guardian angels has left her an outcast, but little does she know
that her gifts will soon expand with a blessing from the archangel Barachiel. She discovers that she is part of an old
prophecy that must bring together angels, sins and virtues to close the gates of Hell â€“ all seven of them. In order to
do this they must defeat each demon that guards the doors. There are many dangers in her future, but Syntyche knows she
will survive to see the day when a great prophet can preach without the fears of evil getting in the way. With the help
of a griffin, phoenix and dragon what could possibly go wrong?
